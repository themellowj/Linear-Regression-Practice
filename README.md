# Project-Linear-Regression-with-Numpy

This project gave a clear understanding of a linear regression algorithm by using Numpy.
Covering with Step-wise python coding inside of jupyter notebook.

#1 Load the Data and Libraries

#2 Visualize the Data

#3 Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)

#4 Gradient Descent

#5 Visualising the Cost Function  𝐽(𝜃)

#6 Plotting the Convergence

#7 Training Data with Linear Regression Fit

#8 Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
